learncards
==========

Learn Cards is a simple module which allows you to host a web server
of custom defined flash cards.

Simply install `learncards` and provide a simple json file defining
all of the questions and answers for the flash cards.

Why did I pick a stupid name like `learncards`? Because someone already
took the name `flashcard` in npm and using `flashcards` seems confusing.
So in come my limited creativity when it comes to naming projects.

## Installing
### Via Git
```bash
git clone git://github.com/brettlangdon/learncards.git
cd ./learncards
npm install

./bin/learncards my_flashcards.json
```

### Via NPM
```bash
npm install -g learncards
learncards my_flashcards.json
```

## Flashcards
A Flashcard json file *MUST* contain a `cards` property where each card is
an object which *MUST* contain a `question` and `answer` property.

An optional top level property of `title` can be provided which sets the
title in the html site accordingly.

### Example
```javascript
{
  "title": "My Flashcards",
  "cards": {
    {
      "question": "Who is the greatest?",
      "answer": "Brett Langdon"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is terrible at naming projects?",
      "answer": "Brett Langdon"
    }
  }
}
```

## Running
There is a binary file included with the installation `learncards`.
If `learncards` is installed globally then the command should be available.
Otherwise you can run the binary directly from the `learncards` directory.

When running you must provide the location of the flashcards json file.

### Example
```bash
learncards my_flashcards.json
```
